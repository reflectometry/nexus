The sample data file, lrcs7301 is an HDF5 file with two histograms.

You can check that the tree interface to NeXus files is working
properly for HDF5 using:

   python -m nexus.tree copy lrcs7301.nxs copy.nxs
   python -m nexus.tree plot copy.nxs Histogram1.data

This load the structure from one file, saves it to another file and
produces a plot.  If that is successful, then basic read/write are
functional.

You can explore the data from ipython:

   $ipython -pylab
   >>> import nexus
   >>> f = nexus.load('lrcs7301.nxs')
   >>> f.Histogram1.data.nxplot()

Tab-completion on the group names shows the names of the entries.
